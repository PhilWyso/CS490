This text file details the final changes we need to get the midend properly running and functional.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STUDENT EXAM SUBMISSION

So when the student is submitting their exam, frontend is still sending the question arrays one by one, the only difference
is that there is now a new header variable added to it.

new frontend array contains

header: submitExamRequest
examName: (contains name of exam)
username: (contains name of user taking exam)
id:     (contains id of question being sent)
answer: (contains students answer for question being sent)

This is array is sent to mid (mid.php), which then sends it to the backend( .... )
backend stores the answers, and returns a "success"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEACHER REVIEW SUBMISSION

When a teacher is requestion an exam, the frontend will send a request to processExam.php in the mid end, which then sends a request
to the backend to return a nested array of a students answers and other information. Midend processes it and returns it back.

FrontEnd sends:

examName
username

Midend Recieves and sends to backend. Backend Returns:
sample nested array: (copy and paste it into jsonviewer to view properly)
{"flag":"true","1":{"id":"1","functionName":"sleepIn","question":"Create an algorithm with the name sleepIn that takes on two boolean paramaters, weekday and vacation, named and ordered accordingly. The parameter weekday is true if it is a weekday, and the parameter vacation is true if we are on vacation. We sleep in if it is not a weekday or we're on vacation. Return true if we sleep in.","topic":"if statement","difficulty":"easy","parameters":"weekday, vacation","input":"false:false, true:false, false:true","output":"true, false, true","pointWorth":"10","teacherNotes":"I went over this in class, and I mentioned this on the exam, you should not have gotton this wrong.","autoNotes":"","grade":"0","answer":"this is the students answer"},"3":{"id":"3","functionName":"sleepIn","question":"Create an algorithm with the name sleepIn that takes on two boolean paramaters, weekday and vacation, named and ordered accordingly. The parameter weekday is true if it is a weekday, and the parameter vacation is true if we are on vacation. We sleep in if it is not a weekday or we're on vacation. Return true if we sleep in.","topic":"if statement","difficulty":"easy","parameters":"weekday, vacation","input":"false:false, true:false, false:true","output":"true, false, true","pointWorth":"10","teacherNotes":"I went over this in class, and I mentioned this on the exam, you should not have gotton this wrong.","autoNotes":"","grade":"0","answer":"this is the students answer"}}


****IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't think the backend should use json_encode when echoing the array. I think the midend should do that, for then
can just recieve the information and then just add autoNotes directly to the array and then json_encode it to the frontend.

Midend Processes:
midend checks the flag variable, 
if it is false, it will grade and set the grade variable and autoNotes variable in each nested array.
if is true, then do nothing with the input.
Midend will need to echo json_encode($array), back to the frontend where the frontend will process it and show it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAM UPDATE REQUEST

When the teacher submits an update to the exam after reviewing it the frontend will send the following for each question:

header: examUpdateRequest
examName
username
id
grade
teacherNotes
autoNotes

mid.php will be recieving this. I think mid.php needs to add the autoNotes variable cuz I don't think it is on there
backend.php will recieve it, and set the flag variable to true for studentExamStatus table. Returns Success on submission
